# UNOFFICIAL ReichLab Metrocast Sandbox Hub 

This is the sandbox/testbed for experimental forecasts used by the Reich Lab to be used before and during the 2025/2026 respiratory virus forecasting season. The hub is modeled after the [Flu MetroCast Forecast Hub](https://reichlab.io/metrocast-dashboard/). The models contained in the hub are instances of models from [idmodels](https://github.com/reichlab/idmodels), as implemented in [operational-models](https://github.com/reichlab/operational-models/), with data pipelines from [iddata](https://github.com/reichlab/iddata/).



## Acknowledgments

This repository follows the guidelines and standards outlined by the [hubverse](https://hubverse.io), which provides a set of data formats and open source tools for modeling hubs.

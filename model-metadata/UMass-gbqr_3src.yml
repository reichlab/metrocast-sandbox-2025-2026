data_sources: "CDC NSSP emergency department surveillance data, CDC ILINet outpatient surveillance data, CDC FluSurv-NET hospitalization data"
methods: "Gradient boosting quantile regression model using three data sources (NSSP, ILINet, FluSurv-NET). The model uses bagging with 100 bootstrap samples, each using 70% of the available data. Features include lagged values of surveillance signals and location-level indicators. A 4th root power transform is applied to stabilize variance. Predictions are made jointly across all locations."

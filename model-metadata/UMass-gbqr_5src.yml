data_sources: "MetroCast Hub target data (NSSP ED surveillance), CDC ILINet outpatient surveillance data, CDC FluSurv-NET hospitalization data, NHSN hospital flu admissions data, NSSP ED visits data"
methods: "Gradient boosting quantile regression model using MetroCast Hub target data as the primary source with supplementary training from all available sources: ILINet outpatient surveillance, FluSurv-NET hospitalization data, NHSN hospital admissions, and NSSP ED visits. The model uses bagging with 100 bootstrap samples (70% of seasons per bag). Features include Taylor coefficients for trend/curvature estimation, rolling means, lagged values, and one-hot encodings of source, aggregation level, and location. A fourth-root power transform is applied to stabilize variance, with per-location scale and center normalization. Predictions are made jointly across all locations with quantile non-crossing correction applied post-prediction."

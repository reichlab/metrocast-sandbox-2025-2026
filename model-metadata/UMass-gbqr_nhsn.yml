data_sources: "MetroCast Hub target data (NSSP ED surveillance), NHSN hospital flu admissions data"
methods: "Gradient boosting quantile regression model using MetroCast Hub target data as the primary source with supplementary training from NHSN hospital flu admissions data. The model uses bagging with 100 bootstrap samples (70% of seasons per bag). Features include Taylor coefficients for trend/curvature estimation, rolling means, lagged values, and one-hot encodings of source, aggregation level, and location. A fourth-root power transform is applied to stabilize variance, with per-location scale and center normalization. Predictions are made jointly across all locations with quantile non-crossing correction applied post-prediction."
